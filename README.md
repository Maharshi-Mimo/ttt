## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. The motivation behind this project is to provide a fun and interactive way to play the game, either against another human player or against the computer.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking spaces in the grid with their respective symbols, usually "X" and "O", with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Rules of the Game
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. Player 1 is X, and Player 2 (or the computer) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw.
